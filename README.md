# FT810-FT813
This is a code library for EVE/EVE2 graphics controller ICs from FTDI/Bridgetek:

It contains code for and has been used with various mikro-controllers and displays.

8-Bit AVR, specifically the 90CAN series

Arduino, Uno, mini-pro, ESP8266

Renesas F1L RH850

The TFTs I used so far:

The examples in the "example_projects" drawer are for use with AtmelStudio7. For Arduino I am using the plugin from www.visualmicro.com .

The platform the code is compiled for is automatically detected thru compiler flags in FT8_config.c / FT8_config.h. These are the only files that should need editing to customize the library to your needs.

Choose between FT80x/FT81x by enabling/disabling the FT8_81X_ENABLE define.

Select the TFT attached by enabling one of the pre-defined setups.

When compiling for AVR you need to provide the clock it is running at in order to make the delay() calls used to initialise the TFT work with the intended timing. Next you provide ports and pins for the TFTs chip-select and power-down pins.


Originally the project went public in the Geman mikrocontroller.net forum, the thread contains some insight: https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/395608
